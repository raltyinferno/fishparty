		Filters contain pyrolucite media to support iron oxidizing bacteria.
Once the iron is oxidized, it is captured and retained in the media. The bacteria, along with a small dose
of oxygen, capture approximately 95% of the iron found in the ground water. The filters are backwashed

after 350,000 gallons of water has been filtered. The backwash is disposed in the domestic sewer
system.

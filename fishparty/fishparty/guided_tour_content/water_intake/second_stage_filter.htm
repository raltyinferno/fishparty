                    Filters also contain pyrolucite, but in the second stage the removal
                    of manganese and the small amount of remaining iron are captured using chemical oxidation and the
                    adsorptive qualities of the media. Hydrogen sulfide is also removed in this stage. Iron, manganese and
                    hydrogen sulfide concentrations post filtration are significantly below EPA drinking water standards.

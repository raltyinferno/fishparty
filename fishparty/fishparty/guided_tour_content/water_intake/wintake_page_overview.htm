Water Intake and Treatment

On- site wells provide all process water for the hatchery. Well water is used instead of
river water because river water contains wild populations of fish that carry naturally occurring
pathogens. Well water is also very stable, with river water experiencing extreme seasonal variations in
temperature and quality. The ground well water has does have high concentrations of iron,
manganese, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and dissolved nitrogen which must be removed or
reduced before the water is supplied to the fish.

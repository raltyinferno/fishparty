<p align="center"> 
    After the water
    passes through the water treatment filters, it is divided into a hot and a cold loop for
    distribution to each rearing module. Water sent to the incubation and start up rearing tanks has
    to been conditioned to remove high concentrations of carbon dioxide and dissolved nitrogen.
    Carbon dioxide is removed by passing water through a gas conditioning tower which removes
    the carbon dioxide and adds oxygen to the water. From there the water flows into vacuum
    degassing towers which apply vacuum pressure to the water removing the dissolved nitrogen.

<p align="center"> 
Rainbow trout, Chinook and coho salmon are ponded moved into 10â€™ diameter
tanks from incubation. These tanks, holding 2,200 gallons each, are initially operated as flow through systems when the fry are small. As the fry grow into fingerling,
these tanks are transitioned to a partial reuse system where 50-75% of the water is reused. The
remaining water is discharged from the system. Fish are typically held in these tanks for 2-3 months.
The fish are then either stocked out in area lakes as fingerling, or moved to larger grow out tanks. The
exception is Arctic char which stay in these tanks for the duration of their rearing.

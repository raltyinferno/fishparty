Gas Conditioning Column
</font>
</h1>

<p align="center"> 
    The gas conditioning column is where the water is aerated,
removing carbon dioxide produced by the fish and adding oxygen consumed by the fish. Water flows
from the top of the column across a diffuser plate, through media that breaks the water flow into
smaller droplets and into the LHO Low Head Oxygenator below. Fans pull air through the column in a
counter current flow which increases the efficiency of the gas conditioning column.

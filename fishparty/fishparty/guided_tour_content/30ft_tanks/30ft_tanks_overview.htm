30ft Tanks

<p align="center"> 
Catchable sized rainbow trout, Arctic grayling and Chinook salmon are reared in large 30’
diameter by 8’ deep tanks. These tanks, holding
about 40,00 gallons each, are operated as 95-97% recirculation systems. In order to operate at this high
level of recirculation, significant filtration is required. This includes a radial flow separator, drum filter,
pump sump, biofilter, bypass column, gas conditioning tower and low head oxygenator. Fish are
typically reared in these tanks for 9-10 months before being stocked out into area lakes as 7-10”
catchable sized fish

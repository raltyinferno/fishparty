In interior Alaska, most of the stocking is done in May and June, with smaller stocking
events occurring in August and September. Fish are primarily pumped into the stocking trucks with a
specially designed pump but can also be netted into trucks. The truck- mounted fish tanks contain
aerators and, compressed oxygen. The tanks are continuously monitored by the driver for temperature and dissolved oxygen. Hatchery staff drive approximately 15,000 miles every summer stocking fish in area lakes. Most lakes are located on the road system while others require alternative access methods such as ATV, airplane, helicopter, or hiking.

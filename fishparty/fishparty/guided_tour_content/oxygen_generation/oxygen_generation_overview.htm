Oxygen Generation

Intensive rearing conditions found in the culture tanks requires supplemental
oxygen to maintain. The hatchery contains two oxygen generators which provide 95% pure oxygen gas
to the fish culture units. These generators operate using the vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) process
which concentrates the oxygen found in ambient air, while discharging the unused nitrogen. The oxygen
gas is then pressurized for use in the Low Head Oxygenator as well as emergency backup oxygen
systems distributed at each culture tank.

                    All fish reared in the hatchery start as an egg. For Arctic grayling, Chinook and coho
                    salmon, eggs are taken from wild adults. For rainbow trout and Arctic char, eggs are produced from a
                    captive brood stock located in the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish Hatchery in Anchorage. Eggs
                    are counted and disinfected in the receiving room before being placed in incubation.

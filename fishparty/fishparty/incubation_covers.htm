                    All fish reared within the hatchery start as eggs. The incubation room consists of 6
                    temperature independent modules, each containing 32 Heath trays. Each tray holds between 7,500
                    and 12,000 eggs depending on egg size. Depending on the species, eggs stay in the trays
                    from as little as 3 weeks, to as long as 3 months. The lights are normally kept off in the incubation room.
                    If eggs or alevin are exposed to light, it can stunt their development or cause increased mortality.
